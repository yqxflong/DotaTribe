10001	What is this place? Where does it lead to?
10002	This is the border of Sun Snow. It used to be home to the humans and blood elves, however, it is now ruled by chaos. If you wish to go any further, you must defeat me first.
10003	How did Sun Snow fall into such a state?
10004	Most of the world is shrouded in the mist of chaos. All of this land's creatures have become restless.
10005	In order to gather information on the location of the relic, we must find human heroes as soon as possible.
10006	Who are you?
10007	Noble blood elf fighter, I'm a warrior looking for the ancient relic.
10008	The ancient relic won't be yielded to mortals that easily. Show me your valor and strength!
10009	Your valor is admirable. However, you still lack the power to control the ancient relic. Go and find the scattered knights ahead for further guidance. Go, you don't have much time!
10010	Almighty leader of the Silver Order, please tell me how to find the ancient relic.
10011	Face my holy light first!
10012	I heard Lightbringer Arthur speak of it many years ago. It is said that the secret of the ancient relic is hidden in a mysterious, sacred land.
10013	It seems that we may need to travel to this sacred land. We must cross the sea and go to the other continent!
10014	Before us lies the Sleeping Sea. Fallen humans, orcs, and the undead can all be found here.
10015	I can sense their fear!
10016	We are approaching the domain of the a certain illustrious mariner. He used to be a legendary sailor, and simply must know the location of the sacred land.
10017	This twisted creature is as repulsive as a black hole.
10018	You'd better enhance your weapon before challenging me. I have a magic wand, you see. Hah!
10019	You'd better keep your distance or I'll turn you into a mindless sheep.
10020	Ignorant demon, you are wasting my time! Now, go back to the hell!
10021	I'm surprised to see you. So the demon didn't manage to eat you?
10022	Almighty captain Kunkka, I'm looking for the sacred land. Please guide me!
10023	My torrent will guide you!
10024	Swing your sword and defend justice. May the power of the tides be with you. Move on, brave warrior!
10025	Taz'dingo!
10026	This forest is the home of the trolls. These creatures seem to be somewhat hostile towards us. Let's get out of here.
10027	It's freaking cold here. I should have brought a sweater.
10028	These guys are always saying strange stuff. Let's teach them a lesson.
10029	Trolls are the best fighters in the world. All the land and food belongs to us!
10030	!@#￥%……&
10031	Stupid humans and elves! Trolls are the best fighters in the world! Just look at the shabby crap you're wearing!
10032	What an arrogant twerp! You'd better improve your equipment first.
10033	Is anyone summoning the exorcist?
10034	I don't want another troll for as long as I live!
10035	The land ahead is the territory of the undead. I've can already sense the wretched creatures.
10036	The continent is covered in darkness. This mountain is burdened with the bodies of fallen undead and orcs. Could these lost souls possibly guide us to the entrance of the sacred land?
10037	Former disciple of the god of order, where is the entrance to the sacred land?
10038	Welcome to the feast of souls.
10039	His soul has fallen, poor creature.
10040	Your soul belongs to me!
10041	His rotten body has been banished along with his paralyzed soul.
10042	I love to see my enemies die under my burning blade.
10043	Is this the end of my power? No!
10044	I need your life… to extend mine!
10045	I should have brought a torch!
10046	Leader of the Blood Axe, may I ask where the entrance to the sacred land lies?
10047	Foolish honor! Tremble before me!
10048	I remember the hatred!
10049	There is only an agglomeration of souls corrupted by hatred and darkness. I'm wasting my time here!
10050	Man are from Mars, and I'm from the grave!
10051	Deranged and lonely souls, let the holy light purify this land!
10052	Cross this area and we'll reach the home of the Dragonborn; one step closer to light and justice. There will be more ancient heroes there. Now is merely the darkness before the dawn!
10053	Coocoo, coocoo...
10054	Another one incapable of speech? It seems all he does is spread nightmares and fear…
10055	That mage is very cunning. Watch out for his curses and dark magic.
10056	I will feast on your soul!
10057	Is that a scythe on his back?
10058	My power is yours. Huh, huh...
10059	That deceitful fiend! I was almost trapped by his magic.
10060	Enough words; it's time for war! For gold and honor!
10061	His word makes me sick.
10062	I'll burn everything to ashes!
10063	Hey! It's not safe to play with fire.
10064	I'm waiting for your advice.
10065	Don't waste my time!
10066	0
10100	Do you want to borrow my power? Defeat me first!
10101	I'll temporarily lend you my power. When you become stronger, you can use my <a type="text" fontsize="22" fontname="ArialRoundedMTBold" fontcolor="{255,0,0}" text="soul"></a>! <a type="text" fontsize="22" fontname="ArialRoundedMTBold" fontcolor="{0,255,0}" text="(Hint: You temporarily have the Axe ability, allowing you to perform Counter-helix when attacked.)"></a>
10102	Axe ability has vanished.
10103	The relic is too powerful. You must become stronger to control it.
10104	I see hope in you. Take these <a type="text" fontsize="22" fontname="ArialRoundedMTBold" fontcolor="{255,0,0}" text="old souls"></a>, you'll need them in combat!<a type="text" fontsize="22" fontname="ArialRoundedMTBold" fontcolor="{0,255,0}" text="(Hint: You feel that you have gained some special abilities.)"></a>
10105	Oblivion doesn't have a physical body. Only spells can damage him. Be careful! <a type="text" fontsize="22" fontname="ArialRoundedMTBold" fontcolor="{0,255,0}" text="(Hint: When Oblivion enters the Void status, he will only take magic damage. Use Fireblast to deal massive damage.)"></a>
10106	I want to possess this powerful ability, too.
10107	I'm invisible...gaseous...and dead...
10108	Why has the sky turned dark? Oh, it's Baranar!

10126	这个对手你还应付不来，我先帮你解决他。
10127	哈哈，让你尝尝我飞盘的厉害。
10128	前面的道路异常凶险，这个“静电场”技能会对你帮助重大的。
10129	他是我勇敢的同伴，我不会让你伤害到他的！
10130	不要多管闲事！

11001	This tower has been standing since before time began. Only true warriors can defeat the demons within it and reach the top. Aside from honor, it is said that treasure also lies hidden in the tower. Are you up for the challenge?
11002	I haven't seen humans in a long time. My body and soul have rotted...my treasure...
11003	It will be a long journey, but you'll soon learn teleportation, won't you?
11004	Don't try to lay your hands on the treasure chest, or I'll smash you to pieces.
11005	Don't touch me! I'm innocent!
11006	Do you want to milk me or what?
